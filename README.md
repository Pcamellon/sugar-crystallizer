It was developed a GUI to monitor two tanks used for a sugar crystallization using Qt 4 IDE and libraries.

Crystallization takes place in a vacuum boiling pan. Thick juice or syrup is fed to the vacuum pans and evaporated until saturated. Seed crystals are added during a strike to grow sugar crystals. The process is continued until a specified crystal size has been reached.
